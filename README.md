# Simon-Game
A personal web project recreating the classic Simon Game to sharpen my JavaScript and jQuery skills. It includes interactive visuals, sound feedback, and responsive design. The game logic handles user input, sequence generation, and error detection with clean UI feedback. Deployed using GitHub Pages for easy access.
